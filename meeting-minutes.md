## 03/15/17

* Confirm GSuite account
* Confirm Google Drive access
* Discuss data assets
	* RFQ customer requests
	* Supplier lists (Car-part.com, ARA, Hollander Eden)
* Discuss how Partsline receives RFQs
* General Q/A on industry and supplier process / needs

Supplier pinch points

* Will they expect this to be free? 
    * Z: I dont think so. Maybe we can charge a one time $199 fee. Other services are not free for supplier
* Terrys Google Next experience with lady thats starting a concierge service, charging $50 per event. We can do the same, but we have to let the market determine what that service charge is. What are customers willing to pay for? Should we charge the supplier as well? Split the fee in 1/2? How low can we go?
    * LESSON: **Customers like flat rate pricing.**
* Needs to be quick and easy for supplies
* Work towards survey and direct contact with suppliers
* Do they have an advertising budget? If so, can we tap into that?
* 

Market Place Model
* Comes with a set of implementation for banking etc.
* The Catch 22 is either get the customer first, or get the suppliers first.
* Our basic model is a supply aggregator, with payment processing
    * Need a top-notch UX 
    * Need suppliers inventories onboard
    * Need automated order fulfillment
    * Which means, we need near-real time inventory database updates
* Kayak, for example, has a data partnership

How are we connecting Suppliers and Customers?
* Ebay has made it easy IMS => Ebay transfer of knowledge
    * Supre easy to list
    * Super easy to immediately make available, right out of IMS 
    * Super easy to sell
* Hollander Parts Exchange

Thoughts on release cycles:

* Start small
* Frequent small releases
* Dogfood that shit. Eat your own dog food.

# Customer experience:

* The app, or Web UI, will own the customer experience. This will be a big competitive advantage as most (all?) car parts websites are pure shit.

# New ideas:

* Go upstream and bring cars to recyclers! Enable regular folks to get real quotes for their vehicles, provide a tow service, and charge $$$ for that shit.
* Possibly consider "Auction for Clunkers" or "junkmycar.com"

Techincal stuff

* Spyders on Rackspace
* Automotix, provides a request service, while competing with suppliers. It is a front end for LKQCorp
* Sean is asking good detailed questoins about how to find parts, and how does the automotix messaging app work.
* The Home Depot threat "I dont want to come back now, ya hear"
* Upsell tooling, instalation manual, specilized part, whatever
